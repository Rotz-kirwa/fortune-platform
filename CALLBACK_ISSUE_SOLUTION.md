# 🔍 M-PESA Callback Issue - Root Cause & Solution

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your investments don't appear automatically because **M-PESA callbacks can't reach your localhost**.

### **What Happens:**
1. ✅ You pay via M-PESA (STK Push works)
2. ✅ M-PESA processes payment successfully  
3. ❌ **M-PESA tries to send callback to**: `https://fortune-platform-1.onrender.com/api/payments/callback`
4. ❌ **But you're testing on**: `http://localhost:4000`
5. ❌ **Callback never reaches your local server**
6. ❌ **Investment stays pending forever**

## 🔧 **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use ngrok (Recommended for Local Testing)**
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 4000

# Update your .env with the ngrok URL
MPESA_CALLBACK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/payments/callback
```

### **Option 2: Manual Callback Simulation (Current Fix)**
```bash
# Run this after each payment to activate investments
node simulate-callback.js
```

### **Option 3: Deploy to Production**
Use your production server where M-PESA can reach the callback URL.

## ✅ **Current Status**

- ✅ **Your 1 KSh investment is now active** (manually activated)
- ✅ **Callback system works** (tested with simulation)
- ✅ **APIs return correct data** (dashboard should show investment)

## 🚀 **For Production**

The callback system will work automatically in production because:
- ✅ M-PESA can reach `https://fortune-platform-1.onrender.com`
- ✅ Callback URL is correctly configured
- ✅ Investment activation logic is working

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **For Local Testing**: Use ngrok or run `simulate-callback.js` after payments
2. **For Production**: Deploy - callbacks will work automatically
3. **Refresh Dashboard**: Your investment should now appear

The system is working correctly - it's just a localhost accessibility issue!
